      description: `Based on T.S. Eliot’s whimsical collection of poems, _Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats_, Andrew Lloyd Webber's popular musical brings together a tribe of Jellicle Cats on a moonlit evening, who must make the "Jellicle choice" to decide which of them will ascend to the mysterious Heaviside Layer to be reborn. Featuring such celebrated standards as the haunting "Memory," Cats was an international phenomenon and its original production was one of the longest running shows on Broadway. A magical, moving, and often hilarious glimpse into the lives of others, _Cats_ takes Eliot's lyrical poetry and puts it into the mouths of a diverse company of singing, dancing felines.\n`,

        "A celebration of the church basement kitchen and the women who work there, _Church Basement Ladies_ features four distinct characters and their relationships as they organize the food and the problems of a rural Minnesota church. From the elderly matriarch of the kitchen to the young bride-to-be learning the proper order of things, the book and music give us a touching, funny look at their lives as we see them handle a record breaking Christmas dinner, the funeral of a dear friend, a Hawaiian Easter Fundraiser, and a steaming hot July wedding. They stave off potential disasters, share and debate recipes, instruct the young, and keep the Pastor on due course while thoroughly enjoying, (and tolerating) each other. Funny and down to earth, you will recognize these ladies as they begin to see the Church year unfold from below the House of God. This is most certainly true!\n",

        "Based on the unbelievable true story of one of the most famous con artists in history, Frank Abagnale Jr., _Catch Me If You Can_ is a rousing musical set in the 1960's. We begin as Frank is captured by Agent Carl Hanratty, after years of pursuit. Frank, however, thinks you deserve to hear his version of the truth, and narrates his life as a hip, dance-heavy variety television show. You'll see Frank, as a teenager, run away from his unhappy home to live a life of great adventure, conning people by assuming a multitude of identities: airplane pilot, doctor, and lawyer, to name a few. A fast, rollicking musical, _Catch Me If You Can_ tells the tale of an ingenious, yet lonely, boy looking for his place in the world.\n",
