Dear Patrons,

This last year has been an incredibly trying time for us all. Thankfully, it does seem like there is an end in sight to the pandemic we have all faced together. We are happy to report that the Post Playhouse, due to difficult but sound decisions made last year, has made it to the other side of 2020. However, there is one final difficult decision to make to get us through the final stretch of this challenging experience.

The Board of Directors and I have decided to remain closed for the 2021 Summer Season at the Post Playhouse. Our primary concern is for the health and safety of our production team, our local audiences, and our visitors to the area. Beyond that, the projected decrease in revenue for this summer poses a substantial risk to the overall fiscal health of our small nonprofit. While there are many positives as we anticipate an end to the pandemic, the organization cannot reasonably predict full audience attendance for a 2021 season. We plan to pick up next year with our 2022 season and be ready to celebrate reopening with you for an entire summer.
 
Now more than ever, we need you, our faithful supporters, to help make sure that we can get to next year. Please rest assured that all monies transferred from 2020 to 2021 will again be transferred to 2022. Today, we also ask that you please consider making an additional donation to support our annual fund during this difficult time. You can [donate here on our website](/donate) or by mailing a check to Post Playhouse, â„… Tim Gaswick, PO Box 749, Chadron, NE 69337.

We hope that you will consider helping us to keep our doors open so that we can continue to bring joy to our community members, visitors, and audiences through live theatrical experiences for years to come. 
 
With Deepest Gratitude,
