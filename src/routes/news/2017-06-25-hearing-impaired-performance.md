Post Playhouse will be partnering with The Regional Program for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing to present a signed performance of _Shrek: The Musical_ on Wednesday July 12, 2017 at 2:00pm. Eighty-one of the people who will be attending will be either deaf or extremely hard-of-hearing and, for the most part, they will be young students. The group will be accompanied by two signers who will stand on the side of the stage and sign the dialogue and songs for those in attendance.

If you'd like to sponsor a ticket or tickets for those attending, you may do so by donating $20 per seat. A donation may be sent to Wally Seiler, 1208 Laramie Avenue, Alliance, Nebraska 69301, or Tim Gaswick, 245 Main Street, Chadron, Nebraska 69337.
