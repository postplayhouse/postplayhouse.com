## Frontier Strings to perform before opening of Mamma Mia

The Frontier Strings ensemble will be performing outside the playhouse before the opening night performance of _Mamma Mia!_

Frontier Strings is comprised of select students who truly encompass Omaha Conservatory of Music’s core values of musical community: passion, dedication, and excellence.

This premiere string ensemble comprised of advanced students performs a variety of repertoire — pop songs, sacred music, fiddle tunes, classical show tunes, and movie music --- all from memory. Frontier Strings performs throughout the community during the academic year and tours during the summer. The group has performed throughout the United States and Europe, delighting audiences everywhere with their stunt fiddling dance moves, and even hula-hooping while performing music at top speed!
