Our opening night audiences will remember Lyle as the man with the camera. Many of the actors in our productions will remember him the same way. It was a rare thing for Lyle to miss an opening night performance or to miss an opportunity to delight folks with the special moments he captured forever.


Lyle was a dear friend of the Playhouse, serving as a board member for many years. He will be sorely missed by all of us.

Opening nights won't be the same without him.
