Dear Friends,

Thank you all for an amazing post-Covid come back 2022 season. I have been
Producing Artistic Director for the past 16 years and I'm proud of the
work we have done at the Post Playhouse presenting theatre in the
Panhandle of Nebraska. It has always been my goal to harness the power of
live theatre to bring people in our communities together and I am so
pleased to have successfully led Post Playhouse in that mission all these
years. I cherish the many friendships here in Northwest Nebraska and have
been very moved by the magic we have made together on the Post Playhouse
stage.

It is with mixed emotions that I am moving on after this summer.
Everything in life has a season and this has been a wonderful season of my
life. However, due to shifting long-term strategy planning within the
organization, I have decided to hand off the reins to a new Artistic
Director to usher Post Playhouse into the future. I wish you all the best
and thank you for your kind support and words of encouragement. I am
looking forward to a little vacation and then finding a new place that
needs my artistic directorship. I hope I'll be able to bring some of the
magic we created at the Post Playhouse along with me. Thank you for all
the memories.

Sincerely,  
Tom Ossowski
