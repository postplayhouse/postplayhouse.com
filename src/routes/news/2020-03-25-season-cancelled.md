<h1 class="font-uber text-3xl text-center mb-4">2021 Season in planning</h1>

The Board of Directors and I, after deep consideration, have decided to cancel the Post Playhouse’s 2020 Summer Season due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Our number one concern has to be with the health and safety of our production team, our local audiences and our visitors to the area. We plan to pick up next year with our 2021 season stronger than ever.

We are not the only theatre cancelling performances through the summer. Nearly all professional theatres across the country have had to take similar measures. The resulting cancellations of public events have very real consequences for theatres and theatre artists across the country. Just like with all industries, nationwide, thousands of theatre professionals’ jobs are at stake not only for this year, but for years to come as many theatres will close permanently. **We are not planning on closing forever.** We are taking every step possible to ensure that we deliver a vibrant and exciting 2021 season next year.

Our first step is calling upon you, our faithful supporters, to **consider transferring your ticket purchases to go to next year's season or to an outright donation** to support Post Playhouse during these difficult times. Without a summer season this year, we do not have as many production expenses, but we also will not be able to count on any further ticket sales to cover our non-production related expenses (utilities, internet, box office, etc.) that we pay every month.

With that in mind, for those who have already purchased tickets for our cancelled 2020 Summer Season, we are offering the following options:

- You may make a fully tax-deductible donation of the value of your ticket back to the Post Playhouse. The Post Playhouse is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization. Please consider this option if you can.
- You may transfer your ticket value to a gift certificate in your name. You will then be able to use this gift certificate on any new ticket purchases made for our 2021 Summer Season. This option will also help us keep the lights on in preparation for 2021.
- 2020 Season Subscriptions can also be transferred to our 2021 Season.
- If you prefer to receive a refund for your tickets for our 2020 Season, we will honor that request.

Whichever choice you make regarding your 2020 ticket purchases, we thank you for being a supporter of the Post Playhouse. We will be personally reaching out to everyone who bought tickets for this season and discussing options. This will take time, but we will get to everyone in due course.

We are also asking our annual donors, show sponsors, and program advertisers to allow us to transfer your contributions to our 2021 Summer Season. We hope that you will consider helping us to keep our doors open and community members thrilled with the excitement of live theatre for years to come.

With Deepest Gratitude and Sincerely,
