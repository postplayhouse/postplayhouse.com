### Box Office positions are open

We are seeking some friendly folks to work in our box office this summer. You'll be helping patrons purchase tickets by using our ticketing software, selling concessions, and potentially helping with some performances by running a spotlight.

Please email Tom Ossowski <tom@postplayhouse.com> with your name, contact information, and a few dates/times that you are available for a call to talk about the position.
