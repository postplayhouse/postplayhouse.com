The following is a reposting of our local actor auditions with a date change. There were community conflicts with our original two dates, so we switched from Friday and Saturday to Saturday and Sunday.

### Local Actor Auditions (No appointment necessary)

Auditions for Adults and Young Actors will be held at Post Playhouse. Join
us at either of our local auditions:

- Saturday, May 7, 2022 at 1:00 PM
- Sunday, May 8, 2022 at 1:00 PM

#### Please bring the following:

1. Closed-toe shoes --- sneakers are best; no sandals, please
2. Clothing that you can move in comfortably (we will be dancing)
3. A headshot or current picture of just you and resum&eacute; (If you do not
   have a headshot/picture and resum&eacute;, do not worry. We will take a
   photo of you and just have you fill out a form, so please attend anyway!)
4. Your schedule for the entire summer (so we can discuss any conflicts)

We will be singing Do-Re-Mi. Please either come prepared to sing part of the song or just learn it with us at auditions.

Adults: please bring a song other than Do-Re-Mi which you have prepared ahead of time.

#### Seeking:

**_The Sound of Music_**

- Males and females of all ages for ensemble roles
- Children to play 6 of the 7 von Trapp children. **(Your actual age doesn't matter, just that you appear to be the approximate ages of these characters)**
  - **Friedrich**: Male, age 14.  
    Friedrich is the oldest boy in the family and remembers what the von Trapp house was like before his mother passed away. He is learning to be a confident man, but with his father often traveling, he lacks someone to show him how.
  - **Louisa**: Female, age 13.  
    Missing her mother very much, Louisa has become quite skilled at playing tricks on the governesses, hiding toads in their pockets or giving the wrong name during introductions. But with Maria, it seems she's met her match.
  - **Kurt**: Male, age 10, but almost 11.  
    The youngest boy, Kurt is sensitive and pretends to not to be hurt by his father's absence. Though he misses his mother, Kurt greatly appreciates Maria from the start.
  - **Brigitta**: Female, age 9.  
    Keenly observant for her age. She is thoughtful and, as she says, “cannot tell a lie.”
  - **Marta**: Female, age 7.  
    Very honest and forthright. Marta likes to enjoy herself and would like a pink parasol for her birthday.
  - **Gretl**: Female, age 5 or 6  
    The youngest of the von Trapp children, Gretl is soft-spoken and shy, but sweet.

**_The Sound of Music_, _Damn Yankees_, and _Something Rotten!_**

- Males and females of all ages for ensemble roles
