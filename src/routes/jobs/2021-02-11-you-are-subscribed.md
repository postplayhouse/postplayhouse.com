Whenever we post a new job opening or new audition information, you'll see a message inside whatever app you are using to read this now. The latest details are always available on our website.

We generally hold professional audtions and start looking for summer staff in the first quarter of the year. Then, if our season calls for additional local talent, we hold auditions for those roles shortly before rehearsals begin in May.
