  <h1 class="h1">Re-opening on Friday!</h1>
  <h2 class="h2">Cancelations end after tonight!</h2>
  <div class="text-sm text-gray-500">
    Last update: {new Date(BUILD_TIME).toLocaleString()}
  </div>

  <p>
    We had to cancel performances from last Saturday through tonight. There was
    never a performance scheduled for tomorrow, and <span class="font-bold"
      >we are pleased to announce that we will be going forward with our
      scheduled opening of Church Basement Ladies on Friday!</span
    >
    Please do check back here as our situation evolves.
  </p>

  <p>
    With audience health a top priority, the decision to cancel a few
    performancews was made after positive Covid test results were detected in
    our company. We know that, while it may be an inconvenience for all, it is
    the best decision we can make for everyone at this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your performance is affected, you may call Post Playhouse to either
    exchange your tickets for another show, request a refund for your tickets or
    donate back to the Post Playhouse. Please be patient if your call is not
    answered immediately.
  </p>

  <p class="font-bold">
    For those who would like to support Post Playhouse to recouperate some
    operating costs for the few days of canceled performances, please
    <a class="link-green" href="/donate">visit our donations page</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your patience and understanding, and we can't wait to see you
    THIS FRIDAY!
