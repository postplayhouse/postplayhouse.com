# Program Ad Information

Thank you so much for supporting Post Playhouse via an ad space purchase in our
program! This page is here to give you information about how to get the most out
of your ad.

First, you should know that the person you'll want to send your materials to is
Don Denton. You can reach him at <don@postplayhouse.com>. He may not yet know
who you are, so put "Program Ad: YOUR BUSINESS NAME" in the subject line. Read
on to know what you should send his way.

## Terminology

We will refer to the following terminology in the rest of this article:

- **Artwork**: any image file such as a SVG, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator file,
  JPEG, PNG, or (least preferred) a PDF
- **DPI (or PPI)**: Dots per inch or pixels per inch. This is a measure of the
  **resolution** of your artwork.
- **Copy**: the text that you'd like to see in your ad. Things like "Visit us!",
  or "Mention Post Playhouse for a $3 discount"

## Dimensions

Your ad is purchased at one of four sizes: Full Page, Half Page, 1/4 Page, or
1/8 Page. The dimensions are explained in the following image:

![chart of ad dimensions](/images/perennials/ad-dimensions.2.png)

> Page Dimensions:  
> 8.375” x 10.875”
> 
> Approximate Ad Dimensions:  
> (The actual ads will be individually sized for fit and finish, hewing close to the following)  
> Full Page: 7.9” x  10.1”  
> Half Page: 7.9” x  5”  
> 1/4 Page: 3.9” x  5”  
> 1/8 Page: 3.9” x  2.4”  

**Please ensure that the artwork you send is close to 300ppi or more.**

For example, if you purchased a 1/8 Page ad and you have a logo that is intended
to span the full width of the ad spot, you'll want to make sure your logo image
is around (3.9 inches * 300 ppi) 1,170 pixels wide.

If your image isn't that big and you have no way of getting a better one from
your designer, don't enlarge it. Just send it to Don as is and let him know that
is the best you've got. Don will make it look as good as possible!

## What we need from you

You are purchasing a space for your ad to run, and we want to be sure that you
understand that you are NOT purchasing any kind of design services. So if you
have no idea  what you'd like to do in the space you've provided, we can't
help you too much in that regard. (Don would actually _love_ to help you design
your ad, but he doesn't have the time to devote to it.)

However, if you have at least _some_ idea of what you'd like to see, Don can
absolutely work with you. Here's the breakdown of what materials we need from
you, based on your level of confidence in your vision for your ad.

### You have some idea what you'd like to see

If you are a little unsure of what you'd like to see in your ad, but you have a
few ideas, we can work with you. The one thing we cannot do is create images for
you.

So just email Don and let him know the few ideas you have about what copy you'd
like to see and the few images you can't decide between. He will choose the best
of the bunch for the ad space size you've purchased and show you the result.

Even if you only have some copy, and your business's logo as your artwork,
that's fine!

### You know exactly what you want

Have your in-house designer create an ad that fits the dimensions you've
purchased, making sure to bake all your ad copy into the image itself. Export
the image at 300ppi and send it along to Don.

### Fonts

Don cannot use any fonts you request unless they are properly licensed. So if
you want a particular font, please create the entire ad yourself as an image,
using your fully-licensed font, and send that to Don.

You may _request_ a font, but if Don doesn't have access to it in his design
tools, he cannot purchase or use it in your ad. He also cannot accept a font
file from you unless the proper licensing information also accompanies the file.

## Additional, helpful materials to send us

- If you have a website, please include the address in your email to Don. He can
use it to get a quick feel for your branding.

- If you've run **other ads** in the past, you can send images of those ads as
examples as well.

- If you have an **in-house designer**, or just the **contact information of the
person that designed your logo**, you can send that as well. Don may not
actually reach out to that person, but if he needs a better resolution of your
logo, their contact information can save several steps.

- If you have the **original logo design files** for your company's logo, please
send those as well. In the last 12 years, Don has received about 4 logos that
were a large enough resolution that he didn't have to go back and ask for a
better/bigger one. Most of the time, someone at the company could locate a
better file.
