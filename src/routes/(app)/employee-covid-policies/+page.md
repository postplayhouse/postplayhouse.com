1. We do not require masks in the building (because of further policies below).
2. We do not require vaccination (since the CDC now says it does not stop the spread to others: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html (as of March 11, 2022) – “Spread” section).
3. We do require tests, but only in the situations described below.
4. For each call (AM, PM, or show call), your sign-in is also a statement that you have not, since your last sign in, experienced any of the symptoms of COVID. (The symptoms will be enumerated near the call sheet). For child actors, someone will explicitly ask them or their parents these questions and do a temperature screening. For other employees, sign-in and self-temperature-screening is expected.
    1. If you have experienced symptoms with or without temperature you must contact Stage Management and leave the premises. In addition:
        1. We will provide you with either a box of 2 COVID tests, or reimburse a box you will/have purchased.
        2. You must take one test today
        3. You must take the other test after your symptoms begin to subside or in two days—whichever is later
        4. If both tests come back negative, you may return the day after your second negative test.
        5. If either test comes back positive, you are excused from rehearsals/performances for 10 days from first symptoms (5 days of transmissibility, plus 5 days of recommended mask use which we cannot adhere to on stage: https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html).
    2. If you have not experienced other symptoms, but do have a temperature
        1. (This section TBD)
