## What to Prepare

Prepare an upbeat song. You may either sing acapella or bring a track to sing along with. You can bring your own speakers or use ours via Bluetooth.

We will do a small dance routine, so bring comfortable clothes and shoes. No open toe shoes, sandals, or crocs. If you tap, you should bring your tap shoes!
