title: An early end to Summer 2024
---

To Our Post Playhouse Community,

As the Board President of Post Playhouse in consultation with Dewayne Barrett, our Artistic Director, I write to inform you that due to ongoing COVID-19 concerns, **we have made the difficult decision to cancel the remainder of our summer season after Friday, August 9thâ€™s performance of Honky Tonk Laundry at 2 pm.**

This challenging decision is made with the utmost priority given to the health and safety of our audience, staff, and artists. Dewayne, the board of directors, and the entire team have been deeply committed to trying to keep our doors open for performances while also keeping everyone safe. We are all deeply saddened to be ending the 2024 season early, and remain devoted to presenting an even more wonderful season in 2025! We will send the 2025 season announcement out once we are through our current situation.

We appreciate your understanding and support. If you have purchased tickets this week and need more information, you can reach out to our box office at tickets@postplayhouse.com.

Thank you for your tremendous support this season and for your patience during these difficult few weeks. We are so grateful for our community!

Sincerely,

Janelle Visser  
Board President, Post Playhouse
