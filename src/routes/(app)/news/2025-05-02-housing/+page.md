## New Company Housing Marks Major Step Toward Post Playhouse’s 60th Anniversary

Post Playhouse is proud to announce the purchase of a home in Crawford, Nebraska, to house professional company members during its annual summer season. Thanks to the generous support of individual donors—including lead gifts from 2 local community members, the Peter Kiewit Foundation, and the Dawes County Travel Board– the home will be renovated and move-in ready within weeks, just in time for the 2025 company to arrive for the season.

Each summer, Post Playhouse brings nearly 40 theatre professionals from across the country to live and work in Northwest Nebraska, offering a full season of high-quality Broadway-style performances from May through August. While Post has a longstanding partnership with Fort Robinson to provide housing for a portion of the company, those spaces are at full capacity, making the availability of additional housing in Crawford essential for continuing to attract top-notch, national talent.

Post Playhouse is deeply grateful to the Crawford community, who have long helped make each summer possible by providing vital rental housing for company members. The addition of this new home will complement that ongoing support and help reduce the annual burden of sourcing multiple rentals in a tight housing market.

“This new home is a vital investment in our future,” said Dewayne Barrett, Artistic Director. “It ensures our ability to provide comfortable, professional accommodations for our artists and opens the door to future growth.”

## Momentum Toward 60 Years and Beyond

In recent years, Post Playhouse has worked diligently to build long-term financial stability. This includes establishing an endowment and completing capital improvements like new seating and upgraded theatre technology to improve the overall audience and artist experience in the historic venue.

By owning property in Crawford, the Playhouse will reduce rental costs, improve recruiting efforts, and support the company’s ability to scale responsibly in the years ahead.

Strategically, as the organization looks toward the future, with 2027 marking 60 years of Post Playhouse, the focus remains on building sustainability from the inside out. Sustainable operations, housing, infrastructure, and endowment growth are all key to ensuring the Post thrives for the next generation of artists and audiences.

“We are grateful for the continued support of our community and all those who have helped make this housing project a reality,” Barrett added. “Together, we’re building not just a season but a sustainable future.”
