title: Post Playhouse Honors Behind-the-Scenes Legacy and Community Support with Two Major Announcements
---

Post Playhouse is proud to announce two milestones that highlight its deep-rooted legacy and thriving community support. At the Annual Cabaret on Aug. 4, 2025, Artistic Director Dewayne Barrett announced the inaugural Ann Stephens Award, a new annual honor that recognizes the recipient’s extraordinary behind-the-scenes contributions to Post Playhouse. In addition, Post Playhouse patrons who attended the Annual Cabaret helped the Post Playhouse raise nearly $8,500 towards its 2026 season.

The Ann Stephens Award, aptly named for a longtime champion of the Post Playhouse will be awarded each season to honor the contributions, often of an individual who works and advocates for the mission of the Post Playhouse. A recipient’s impact can be broken down into six categories: outstanding service, dedication of time and energy, embodiment of Post Playhouse’s spirit, impact beyond financial contributions, and inspiration of others. This award is bestowed upon someone who shines in every category, as decided upon by the current Artistic Director, and is not open to applications or nominations.

The inaugural 2025 recipient is none other than Ann Stephens herself. Stephens, a Crawford, Nebraska, resident, has been a longtime employee and volunteer for the Post Playhouse. She is currently the off season Box Office Manager and typically greets most patrons nightly at the door.

"Ann has given so much love, dedication, passion and endless amounts of time to making Post Playhouse a success each summer. Each year she will be honored by giving a new recipient the award! We love you Ann," said Artistic Director Dewayne Barrett.

The Annual Cabaret allows theatre lovers and the Post Playhouse to come together and celebrate the closing of the season, as well as look ahead to next year. Company members, who donate their time, alongside local talent, sing selections from next year’s season of shows as well as a variety of hand-picked numbers. Thanks to the talents and efforts of so many, including generous contributions from Post Playhouse enthusiasts, the Cabaret raised nearly $8,500 in funds for its 2026 season.

“Having a Cabaret at the end of Post Playhouse’s season is such a wonderful way to celebrate our audiences, the community, and the wonderful company of professional theatre artists who come from around the country. What started as a fun season announcement 'teaser' in 2018 has grown into a community event that raised nearly $8,500 to support the Playhouse, making a significant impact in our operations each year. In my years working in the arts, I find it rare to have a community so supportive of a theatre at every level. From feeding the artists, to fixing our flat tires on the highway, to welcoming us into their homes, we all feel so loved by the people here,” said Developmental Director Em Laudeman.

Post Playhouse, Inc. is Northwestern Nebraska's favorite live theatre company, producing several musicals running in a repertory schedule every summer by bringing together highly skilled creative professionals from across the country and nearby. Post Playhouse, Inc. performs its productions at the historic Fort Robinson State Park theatre.
