The Post Playhouse recognizes art as part of being human, uniting us through storytelling and shared experiences. The art of theatre has the power to bring people together while shedding light on difficult times. We are facing one such time.

We believe in compassion, understanding, community, and humanity.

Today, we mourn the loss of black lives, and we emphatically stand in solidarity with our black members of the theatre community and artists, and our black communities at large. As our nation grieves, we offer support and we are committed to inspiring change by listening, learning, and through compassionate action.
