We asked a few folks from years past to rewrite a few lyrics to celebrate the return of Post Playhouse next summer.

While we know this cannot replace the joy of watching a performance on the Post Playhouse stage, we hope you still enjoyed this fun video. We all miss you dearly and cannot wait to be back in person together again next season!

If you’d like to make a tax-deductible donation to Post Playhouse to help us continue to plan and prepare for our 2022 season, a gift of any amount would be greatly appreciated.
