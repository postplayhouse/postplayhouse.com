Come join the cast and company at Post Playhouse one week from today for our annual cabaret and fundraiser on **Monday, August 5th at 7 pm** where we will conclude with announcing our 2025 Season of shows! Make sure you are there to be the first group to hear the news!

This will be a special evening to celebrate our 2024 season and enjoy some wonderful entertainment. Hors dâ€™oeuvres and a selection of beverages will be available.

All proceeds raised at the event will go to support our nonprofit theatre and allow us to continue connecting with our community while bringing professionals from all over the country to experience our wonderful little corner of Nebraska for the summer!

**Please consider donating $25 or more per person that attends the performance.**

**Seats are on a first come first served basis and are going fast!
