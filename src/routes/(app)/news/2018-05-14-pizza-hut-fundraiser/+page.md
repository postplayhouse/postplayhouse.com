Got lunch or dinner plans this Friday? We suggest Pizza Hut.

For the entire business day on this Friday, May 18th, order anything from either the [Pizza Hut in Gordon, NE](https://www.pizzahut.com/index.php#/locations/nebraska/gordon/009231) or the [Pizza Hut in Alliance, NE](https://www.pizzahut.com/index.php#/locations/nebraska/alliance/006138) and you'll be helping the Post Playhouse. Both locations are generously donating 2% of the day's receipts to Post!

Thanks so much to both Pizza Hut locations for helping fund this summer's shows!
