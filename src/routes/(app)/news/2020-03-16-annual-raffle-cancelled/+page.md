title: "Annual Raffle Cancelled"

Due to the current health situation, we have decided to cancel our upcoming annual raffle. We will still be doing a drawing to determine winners, but we will not be rescheduling the entire event. Winners will be announced here on the website and also contacted directly.

This is definitely a blow to the Post Playhouse, as the events on that evening were great for building community and for strengthening our relationship to those patrons who took part in our raffles. But our concerns for the health and safety of all our friends and family certainly comes first.

We thank you in advance for your understanding, and though we aren't going to see you in person this spring, we appreciate all you do for us and we cannot wait to see you all this summer!
