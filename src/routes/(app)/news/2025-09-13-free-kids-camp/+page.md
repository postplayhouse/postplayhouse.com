title: Post Playhouse launches free Kids Camp; expands theatre education through 2026
---

This summer, Post Playhouse launched its inaugural Kids Camp, a free five-day theatre program for children ages 3-18 at Fort Robinson State Park. Twenty-five children from Crawford, Harrison, Chadron, and Omaha participated in the camp led by Camp Director Lindsey Nordby. Post Playhouse actors and technicians volunteered their time to teach, and the camp concluded with a live performance on the Post Playhouse stage.

The camp, which was offered free of charge to ensure access for children, was made possible through the generous support of the Bill and Virginia Coffee Family Foundation, as well as the Richard P. Kimmel and Laurine Kimmel Charitable Foundation, and the Ethel S. Abbott Foundation.

"This program allows students to push themselves out of their comfort zone, challenge themselves, and feel supported and loved while learning about theatre," said Nordby. "For many of them, it is their first time performing in front of other people. They get the opportunity to engage with professional actors from across the country right in their backyard. This program is paving the way for future theatre artists by giving kids hands-on exposure to the theatre industry."

In addition to the camp, Post Playhouse’s 2025 season featured Nebraska youth and adults in two mainstage productions, reinforcing the theatre’s mission to serve the community through meaningful engagement.

Looking ahead, Post Playhouse is excited to announce the Bill and Virginia Coffee Family Foundation has already committed to supporting the Kids Camp again in 2026, helping continue this vital work. Plans for next year’s education programs also include further collaboration with local educators and an ongoing partnership with Chadron State College, where college students have the opportunity to audition for and join the professional company.

"As arts education opportunities shrink nationwide—especially in rural areas—we’re committed to creating access here at home," said Artistic Director, Dewayne Barrett. "Theatre should be for everyone."

With its 60th anniversary approaching in 2027, Post Playhouse remains focused on expanding community and educational outreach, offering community participation, seasonal jobs, and opportunities that enrich the region’s cultural and economic life.
