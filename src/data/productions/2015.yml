    <p>Here is Rydell High's senior class of 1959: duck-tailed, hot-rodding "Burger Palace Boys" and their gum-snapping, hip-shaking "Pink Ladies" in bobby sox and pedal pushers, evoking the look and sound of the 1950s in this rollicking musical. Head "greaser" Danny Zuko and new (good) girl Sandy Dumbrowski try to relive the high romance of their "Summer Nights" as the rest of the gang sings and dances its way through such songs as "Greased Lightnin'", "It's Raining on Prom Night", "Alone at the Drive-In Movie" recalling the music of Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Elvis Presley that became the soundtrack of a generation.</p>
    <p>An 8-year run on Broadway and two subsequent revivals along with innumerable school and community productions place *Grease* among the world's most popular musicals.</p>

    <p>This tender story of family, friendship and acceptance teaches us that it really is a wonderful thing to "love who you love."</p>
    <p>Alfie Byrne is a bus conductor in 1964 Dublin whose heart holds aspirations for something more. He attempts to put on a community production of Oscar Wilde's Salome in the local church hall with his dear friends who ride his bus. As the production shapes up to be comically amateur, he and his fellow artists each in their own way confront the forces of bigotry and shame.</p>
    <p>A Man of No Importance is a rare gem in the canon of musical theatre, one which combines the depth and drama of a play with the lyricism and comedy of a musical. A tender and beautifully-woven tale of love, friendship and the coming to terms with who we are that is sure to move and inspire audiences.</p>
    <p>A Man of No Importance is a "beautiful fable of loneliness, acceptance, love, and the value of art for art's sake."---DC Theatre Scene</p>
    <p>"A wonderfully heartfelt story without being too saccharine. A close examination of repression, censorship, and freedom to pursue the loves you love and the stories you are drawn to tell."---Joshua McTiernan</p>

    <p>Based on a story by Larry L. King</p>
    <p>Popularized by the movie starring Dolly Parton, this happy go lucky view of small town vice and statewide political side-stepping recounts the good times and the demise of the Chicken Ranch, known since the 1850s as one of the better pleasure palaces in all of Texas. Governors, senators, mayors, and even victorious college football teams frequent Miss Mona's cozy bordello until that puritan nemesis Watchdog focuses his television cameras and his righteous indignation on the institution.</p>
    <p>"Utterly charming, lively" --- New York Daily News</p>
    <p>"Humorous and good natured." --- New York Post</p>
    <p>"A font of fun and friendliness, engagingly rich in regional nostalgia and spiced with delicate bawdry. The country and western score is a delight." --- Time</p>

    The timeless enchantment of a magical fairy tale is reborn with the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmarks of originality, charm and elegance. Originally presented on television in 1957 starring Julie Andrews, Rodgers & Hammerstein's *Cinderella* was the most widely viewed program in the history of the medium. Its recreation in 1965 starring Lesley Ann Warren was no less successful in transporting a new generation to the miraculous kingdom of dreams-come-true, and so was a second remake in 1997, which starred Brandy as Cinderella and Whitney Houston as her Fairy Godmother. As adapted for the stage, with great warmth and more than a touch of hilarity, the hearts of children and adults alike still soar when the slipper fits.
