    Based on the Oscar-winning DreamWorks Animation film, *Shrek The Musical* is a Tony Award-winning fairy tale adventure, featuring all new songs from Jeanine Tesori (*Thoroughly Modern Millie*; *Caroline, or Change*) and a sidesplitting book by David Lindsay-Abaire. *Shrek* brings all the beloved characters you know from the film to life on stage and proves there's more to the story than meets the ears.

    "Once upon a time, there was a little ogre named Shrek..." And thus begins the tale of an unlikely hero who finds himself on a life-changing journey alongside a wisecracking Donkey and a feisty princess who resists her rescue. Throw in a short-tempered bad guy, a cookie with an attitude and over a dozen other fairy tale misfits, and you've got the kind of mess that calls for a real hero. Luckily, there's one on hand... and his name is Shrek.

    *Shrek* presents a treasure trove of creative opportunities, including costumes, sets, puppets (there is a fire-breathing dragon after all) and more! Irreverently fun for the whole family, *Shrek* proves that beauty is truly in the eye of the ogre.

    From the creators of the record-breaking Broadway sensation, *The Producers*, comes this monster new musical comedy. The comedy genius, Mel Brooks, adapts his legendarily funny film into a brilliant stage creation – *Young Frankenstein*!

    Grandson of the infamous Victor Frankenstein, Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced "Fronk-en-steen") inherits his family's estate in Transylvania. With the help of a hunchbacked sidekick, Igor (pronounced "Eye-gore"), and a leggy lab assistant, Inga (pronounced normally), Frederick finds himself in the mad scientist shoes of his ancestors. "It's alive!" he exclaims as he brings to life a creature to rival his grandfather's. Eventually, of course, the monster escapes and hilarity continuously abounds.

    Every bit as relevant to audience members who will remember the original as it will be to newcomers, Young Frankenstein has all the of panache of the screen sensation with a little extra theatrical flair added. It will surely be the perfect opportunity for a production company to showcase an array of talents. With such memorable tunes as "The Transylvania Mania," "He Vas My Boyfriend" and "Puttin' on the Ritz," *Young Frankenstein* is scientifically proven, monstrously good entertainment.
