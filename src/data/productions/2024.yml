A young couple stumbles into a castle inhabited by weirdos from the planet Transylvania including Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry). A marvelous musical spoof which urges.

    Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor star in one of the greatest musicals ever filmed. Musician Don Lockwood (Kelly) rises to stardom during Hollywood's silent-movie era--paired with the beautiful, jealous and dumb Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). When Lockwood becomes attracted to young studio singer Kathy Selden (Reynolds), Lamont has her fired. But with the introduction of talking pictures, audiences laugh when they hear Lockwood speak for the first time--and the studio uses Selden to dub her voice. Set during the advent of "talkies," this film's classic song-and-dance numbers celebrate the beginning of movie musicals. Provided through Swank Motion Pictures, Inc.
