    For the third chapter in the Nunsense series, the ladies with the antics are back! In Nunsense Jamboree, we rejoin Sister Amnesia. This time around, she’s completed her first album and has launched into a tour with Sister Robert Anne, Sister Mary Leo, and a whole cast of hilarious characters! After remembering her lifelong dream of becoming a country singer in Nunsense, and finally securing a recording contract in Nunsense II: The Second Coming, this is the pay-off we’ve all been waiting for.

    This hilarious, offbeat murder mystery musical farce juggles mistaken identities, six million bucks in diamonds, and a corpse in a wheelchair. It all starts when an unassuming shoe salesman is forced to take the embalmed body of his recently murdered uncle on a vacation to Monte Carlo. If he can pass is uncle off as alive, he’ll inherit $6,000,000. If not, well… Based on the novel, The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, this laugh and a half won the Richard Rodger Production Award and the Helen Hayes Award for Best Musical. Our English gentleman Harry will find love, adventure, and, perhaps, the meaning of family — even if it’s with a deceased relative.
