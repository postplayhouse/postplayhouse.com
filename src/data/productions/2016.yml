    The classic story tells of Belle, a young woman in a provincial town, and the Beast, who is really a young prince trapped under the spell of an enchantress. If the Beast can learn to love and be loved, the curse will end and he will be transformed to his former self. But time is running out. If the Beast does not learn his lesson soon, he and his household will be doomed for all eternity.

    *The Addams Family* features an original story, and it's every father's nightmare. Wednesday Addams, the ultimate princess of darkness, has grown up and fallen in love with a sweet, smart young man from a respectable family - a man her parents have never met. And if that weren't upsetting enough, Wednesday confides in her father and begs him not to tell her mother. Now, Gomez Addams must do something he's never done before - keep a secret from his beloved wife, Morticia. Everything will change for the whole family on the fateful night they host a dinner for Wednesday's 'normal' boyfriend and his parents.

    *Cabaret* is an award winning classic of the American musical theatre repertoire. Musical numbers include "It Couldn't Please Me More," "Willkommen," "Cabaret," "Don't Tell Mama," and "Two Ladies."
    
    The scene is a night club in Berlin, as the 1920's are drawing to a close. The Master of Ceremonies welcomes the audience to the show and assures them that, whatever their troubles, they will forget them at the Cabaret. On the train to Berlin we find Cliff, a young American writer, and Ernst, a German who surprises Cliff by putting his briefcase among Cliff's luggage at the German border. History is in the process of being made.

    Lovingly ripped off from the classic film comedy *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, *Spamalot* retells the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and features a bevy of beautiful show girls, not to mention cows, killer rabbits, and French people. Did we mention the bevy of beautiful show girls?
    
    The 2005 Broadway production won three Tony Awards, including "Best Musical," and received 14 Tony Award nominations.
