    Hello. My name is Barrett Vogel. I am the 8-year-old son of Joe and Amanda Vogel of Crawford.

    Barrett is excited to be coming out of his shell to perform his (almost first) season in The Wizard of Oz. Barrett could be seen before in 2016 making his debut at Post when he was a 3-month-old baby in Beauty and The Beast while his mom and sister performed. Barrett enjoys all things nature. He loves exploring and hiking, rock hunting and collecting. Hunting for wildlife is a favorite. He also likes riding his bike, playing video games, and swimming, especially in the ocean. Barrett is enjoying his first season of playing baseball this summer. Barrett is thankful to have this opportunity to be a part of Post Playhouse this season.

    Thank you to Dewayne for being my friend. Now let’s get to dancing! Enjoy the show everyone and follow the yellow brick road.
