    Hello, welcome to the Post Playhouse. My name is Isabella Winters. I am ten years old and will be a fifth grader next year at the Chadron Middle School. I auditioned for the Post Playhouse by singing acapella “Heads Carolina Tails California” by Cole Swindell. I was ecstatic when my mom informed me I was cast as part of the ensemble in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat play. When I am not busy with school, I enjoy playing with my friends, bike riding, volleyball, dance and 4H activities. I also enjoy attending our local Lutheran church. I have a four-year-old sister who keeps me on my toes and makes me laugh. Thank you for coming out and supporting the performing arts.
