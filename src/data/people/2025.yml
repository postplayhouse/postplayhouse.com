    Theo is excited to be joining the Post Playhouse for his first season as a Tech worker and Lighting Designer in the space. He has been designing lights for shows such as *Legally Blonde*, *Picture of Dorian Grey*, *Hadestown (Teen Edition)*---and many more---for years. He looks forward to continuing to practice his passion on a new stage---the midwest! Currently studying at Olympic Community College, Theo will be transferring to a four-year university next year to further his existing knowledge of Lighting Design and theater tech. Although wary of tornadoes and bison, Theo is enthusiastic about his first ever trip to Nebraska, and can’t wait to get started with the cast and crew.
