    This is Tom Hudson's first season with Post Playhouse, and he couldn't be more thrilled to be part of this amazing company, and to meet the wonderful, supportive patrons and citizens of in northwestern Nebraska!
    
    Raised on the beaches of Galveston, Tom Hudson is a native Texan who has never quite been able to stay in one place! Mr. Hudson became interested in design early on when, as a young boy, he was taken to an exhibit of costume s worn in the BBC production of The Six Wives of Henry the Eighth, and discovered that the jewelry was made from sprockets, nuts, and bolts. Thus began a career of seeing things not as they are, but of what they might become. Notably, while only 15 years of age, Mr. Hudson, accidentally, became the youngest recipient of the USITT Design America Commendation when, his high school theater teacher misunderstood the requirements for entry (it only being open to working professionals), and sent in three costume designs executed by Tom for the play The Torchbearers, where he was displayed alongside such venerable artists such as Theoni V. Aldredge and Ming Cho Lee
    
    Mr. Hudson received his BFA from East Texas State University, and his MA from Carnegie Mellon University, and is a museum curator with his discipline being historic textiles and conservation. Over the past 30 years Tom has designed costumes on more than 250 productions for such institutions as, New York City Opera, Seattle Opera, and Club Med, with Monteverdi's Il Rittorno d'Ullisse in Patria and Rossini's La Cenerentola being two favorites.
    
    In recent years, Mr. Hudson has made forays into the Central and South American theatrical markets with works for the Republic of Panama, and Carnival in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
    
    Tom Hudson, is also a proud veteran of the United States Navy, achieving the rank of Petty Officer Second Class, and served during the first Gulf War. It was during his European deployment that he was able to develop and refine his design skills by working with Ta Fantastika in Prague, Republic of Czech and Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania, Sicily, and where he discovered his passion for masks, large scale puppetry, and youth theater.
    
    Tom is also a writer and producer for his own companies, Spellbound Theatricals, and Inner Circle, with scripts that range from adult-oriented farces such as: Attack of the Martian Space Babes and, A Very Naughty Lady, to classics, The Odyssey and Anne of Green Gables, as well as faith based offerings; The Story of Esther, and Respectfully Yours, Daniel. He is also working on writing his first textbook for young costume designers as a compendium of tips and tricks for setting up and operating a small costume shop.
    
    Tom currently calls southwestern Minnesota home, and lives in a 110 year old converted hunting cabin, on the shores of a spring fed lake, with an over-fed Beagle, a neurotic Toy Aussie Shepherd, and a cat who will never know he isn't the King of Siam.

When he’s not galloping across his family’s horse ranch on his trusty pony, Shaggy, or forging steel at their horseshoeing school, you can usually find him behind his little camera, directing Westerns starring his siblings and cousins --- or in front of the camera, filling roles left by his limited cast. He can often be heard practicing his yodeling or strumming on his ukulele and singing, and there is always evidence of his presence left wherever he’s been in the form of his funny and detailed sketches. Connor is smack dab in the middle of four siblings and will attend 4th grade at Hemingford Elementary this fall, where he is excited to participate in his fourth year of the Hemingford Holiday Play in December.

    The Sherman Brothers’ career as leading composer/lyricists in family entertainment spans almost 50 years and includes two Academy Awards Best Score and Best Song for _Mary Poppins_.

    The work of the brothers Richard M Sherman and Robert B Sherman is enjoying a fresh chapter of success in musical theatre with sensational stage revivals of _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_ and _Mary Poppins_ now playing across the UK. _Chitty_ originally opened in the West End in 2002 going on to become the longest-running musical ever at the London Palladium, before playing Broadway and beyond, garnering huge international success. The stage production of _Mary Poppins_, co-produced by Disney and Cameron Mackintosh, opened to critical acclaim in London in 2004, winning two Olivier Awards, with the Broadway production running for six years. _The Jungle Book_, another Shermans/Disney favourite, has also recently made the screen-to-stage transition, premiering at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago.

    The Sherman Brothers gained recognition in popular music with several top-ten hits - among them _You're Sixteen_, _Let's Get Together_ and _Tall Paul_. 1960 marked the start of a phenomenal 10 year association with Walt Disney, during which time they composed over 150 songs for his films, TV shows, Disneyland and other theme parks. Their Disney credits include the films _The Jungle Book, The Parent Trap, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Sword and the Stone, The Aristocats, The Happiest Millionaire_, the _Winnie the Pooh_ series, and of course _Mary Poppins_. They also wrote the most translated and performed song on earth, "It's a Small World (After All)".

    They went on to compose song scores for _Snoppy Come Home_, _Charlotte's Web_, the Broadway hit musical _Over Here!_ and the ‘fantasmagorical’ _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_ - with its Oscar nominated title song.

    The Sherman Brothers created screenplays and song scores for _Tom Sawyer_ (their music won First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival),_Huckleberry Finn_, the 1976 Royal Film Performance _The Slipper and the Rose_ (with co-author Bryan Forbes), and _The Magic of Lassie_ which also earned them their 9th Academy Award nomination for Best Song. More recent credits include the book _Walt's Time_ - a wonderful autobiographical and pictorial journey through their song-writing years; the Disney hit animated feature _The Tigger Movie_, the stage musical _Busker Alley_ starring Tommy Tune in the United States and _Beverly Hills Cop 3_.

    In addition to their Oscars, other honours awarded to the Sherman Brothers include 3 Grammys, 24 Gold and Platinum Albums, as well as a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame.

    Robert Sherman died peacefully in London in March 2012.

    Meredith Willson was born in 1902 in Mason City, Iowa. He learned to play the flute as a child and began playing semi-professionally while still in high school. After high school he left Iowa to study at the Damrosch Institute of Musical Art (later the Julliard School), receiving flute instruction from Georges Barrere, the world-renown flutist. While still attending the Institute, he was hired as principle flutist and piccolo player for the John Philip Sousa Band. He later joined the New York Philharmonic Orchestra where he was 1st flutist. He became musical director for various radio programs throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, including Tallulah Bankhead's program, The Big Show," for which he wrote the hit song "May The Lord Bless and Keep You." He composed the scores for the movies _The Great Dictator_ and _The Little Foxes_, as well as symphonic, band, and choral works, including _The Jervis Bay: Symphonic Variations on an American Theme_ and _Anthem of the Atomic Age_. Willson wrote three Broadway musicals: _The Music Man_, his first and most successful; _The Unsinkable Molly Brown_ (music and lyrics), and _Here's Love_ (book, music and lyrics). As an author he has published two autobiographical works (_And There I Stood with My Piccolo and Eggs I Have Laid_), one novel (_Who Did What to Fedalia_) and a memoir about the making of _The Music Man_ (_But He Doesn't Know the Territory_).
