    This is Tom Hudson's first season with Post Playhouse, and he couldn't be more thrilled to be part of this amazing company, and to meet the wonderful, supportive patrons and citizens of in northwestern Nebraska!

    Raised on the beaches of Galveston, Tom Hudson is a native Texan who has never quite been able to stay in one place! Mr. Hudson became interested in design early on when, as a young boy, he was taken to an exhibit of costume s worn in the BBC production of The Six Wives of Henry the Eighth, and discovered that the jewelry was made from sprockets, nuts, and bolts. Thus began a career of seeing things not as they are, but of what they might become. Notably, while only 15 years of age, Mr. Hudson, accidentally, became the youngest recipient of the USITT Design America Commendation when, his high school theater teacher misunderstood the requirements for entry (it only being open to working professionals), and sent in three costume designs executed by Tom for the play The Torchbearers, where he was displayed alongside such venerable artists such as Theoni V. Aldredge and Ming Cho Lee

    Mr. Hudson received his BFA from East Texas State University, and his MA from Carnegie Mellon University, and is a museum curator with his discipline being historic textiles and conservation. Over the past 30 years Tom has designed costumes on more than 250 productions for such institutions as, New York City Opera, Seattle Opera, and Club Med, with Monteverdi's Il Rittorno d'Ullisse in Patria and Rossini's La Cenerentola being two favorites.

    In recent years, Mr. Hudson has made forays into the Central and South American theatrical markets with works for the Republic of Panama, and Carnival in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

    Tom Hudson, is also a proud veteran of the United States Navy, achieving the rank of Petty Officer Second Class, and served during the first Gulf War. It was during his European deployment that he was able to develop and refine his design skills by working with Ta Fantastika in Prague, Republic of Czech and Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania, Sicily, and where he discovered his passion for masks, large scale puppetry, and youth theater.

    Tom is also a writer and producer for his own companies, Spellbound Theatricals, and Inner Circle, with scripts that range from adult-oriented farces such as: Attack of the Martian Space Babes and, A Very Naughty Lady, to classics, The Odyssey and Anne of Green Gables, as well as faith based offerings; The Story of Esther, and Respectfully Yours, Daniel. He is also working on writing his first textbook for young costume designers as a compendium of tips and tricks for setting up and operating a small costume shop.

    Tom currently calls southwestern Minnesota home, and lives in a 110 year old converted hunting cabin, on the shores of a spring fed lake, with an over-fed Beagle, a neurotic Toy Aussie Shepherd, and a cat who will never know he isn't the King of Siam.

    The Sherman Brothers’ career as leading composer/lyricists in family entertainment spans almost 50 years and includes two Academy Awards Best Score and Best Song for _Mary Poppins_.

    The work of the brothers Richard M Sherman and Robert B Sherman is enjoying a fresh chapter of success in musical theatre with sensational stage revivals of _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_ and _Mary Poppins_ now playing across the UK. _Chitty_ originally opened in the West End in 2002 going on to become the longest-running musical ever at the London Palladium, before playing Broadway and beyond, garnering huge international success. The stage production of _Mary Poppins_, co-produced by Disney and Cameron Mackintosh, opened to critical acclaim in London in 2004, winning two Olivier Awards, with the Broadway production running for six years. _The Jungle Book_, another Shermans/Disney favourite, has also recently made the screen-to-stage transition, premiering at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago.

    The Sherman Brothers gained recognition in popular music with several top-ten hits - among them _You're Sixteen_, _Let's Get Together_ and _Tall Paul_. 1960 marked the start of a phenomenal 10 year association with Walt Disney, during which time they composed over 150 songs for his films, TV shows, Disneyland and other theme parks. Their Disney credits include the films _The Jungle Book, The Parent Trap, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Sword and the Stone, The Aristocats, The Happiest Millionaire_, the _Winnie the Pooh_ series, and of course _Mary Poppins_. They also wrote the most translated and performed song on earth, "It's a Small World (After All)".

    They went on to compose song scores for _Snoppy Come Home_, _Charlotte's Web_, the Broadway hit musical _Over Here!_ and the ‘fantasmagorical’ _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_ - with its Oscar nominated title song.

    The Sherman Brothers created screenplays and song scores for _Tom Sawyer_ (their music won First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival),_Huckleberry Finn_, the 1976 Royal Film Performance _The Slipper and the Rose_ (with co-author Bryan Forbes), and _The Magic of Lassie_ which also earned them their 9th Academy Award nomination for Best Song. More recent credits include the book _Walt's Time_ - a wonderful autobiographical and pictorial journey through their song-writing years; the Disney hit animated feature _The Tigger Movie_, the stage musical _Busker Alley_ starring Tommy Tune in the United States and _Beverly Hills Cop 3_.

    In addition to their Oscars, other honours awarded to the Sherman Brothers include 3 Grammys, 24 Gold and Platinum Albums, as well as a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame.

    Robert Sherman died peacefully in London in March 2012.

    For over 50 years Cameron Mackintosh has been producing more musicals than anyone else in history, including the three longest-running musicals of all time: _Les Misérables_, _The Phantom of the Opera_ and _CATS_. Joining this list of legendary titles, his co-production with Disney of _Mary Poppins_ continues to break records and disperse her magic globally. Following its huge recent success in the West End, his new production of _Miss Saigon_ is now playing a National Tour of the UK and will tour in North America later this year whilst the much loved _Kinky Boots_, co-produced by Cameron in the West End and in Australia, continues to kick up its heels.

    Cameron also enjoys producing new versions of classics including _Oliver!, My Fair Lady_, the longest running production ever of _Follies_ and recently reinventing _Half a Sixpence_ in the West End to great acclaim. Other original musicals he has produced include _Little Shop of Horrors, Side By Side By Sondheim, Martin Guerre, Betty Blue Eyes_, and _The Witches of Eastwick_.

    Cameron, with Working Title and Universal, produced the award-winning film version of _Les Misérables_. A film of the 25th Anniversary performance of the new stage production of _Miss Saigon_ was screened in cinemas worldwide in 2016.

    He owns eight West End theatres: Prince of Wales, Gielgud, Queen's, Wyndham's, Noël Coward, Novello and Prince Edward, all of which have been spectacularly refurbished, and the recently acquired Victoria Palace which, following a major rebuild and restoration, reopened at the end of last year with the award winning American musical, _Hamilton_.

    He is also the co-owner of Music Theatre International, the world's largest library of secondary rights of many of the greatest musicals ever written. Cameron was knighted in the 1996 New Year's Honours for his services to the British Theatre and has recently been the first British producer elected to Broadway's Theater Hall of Fame. In 1990, Cameron inaugurated the Chair of Contemporary Theatre at St Catherine's College in Oxford University, currently held by Sir Tom Stoppard.
