    Thrilled to be teaming up with creative collaboraters here at Post Playhouse, Lori and the show's writer, Larry L. King, hail from the same alma mater, Texas Tech University.  So she feels "down right at home" talkin' about Texas!  Lori received more of her artistic training at University of Illinois, Harvard University, and The National School of Music, San Jose, Costa Rica.  Some fond memories include working alongside Robert Harling (*Steel Magnolias*) and Ernest Thompson (*On Golden Pond*). Lori directed the Asia premiere of *Godspell* in Singapore and while there, she appeared in the world premiere musical production of *Judah Ben Hur*. Elsewhere as director, she managed several seasons at Country Theatre Workshop just outside Chicago. Among her favorite roles, she lists Lady Catherine in a most recent production of *Pride And Prejudice* in Hollywood, where she is a founding member of Actors Co-op, one of the nation's leading small professional theatre companies. Lori stars as Maggie Grace's (*Taken*) mother in a Sony project, *Rachel's Room*. Lori appears in a number of indie shorts and has PBS series credits. Back in the L.A. area, Lori is teacher to hundreds of young children in after-school music theatre programs. Her web series, *Recycling Hope*, tells stories of lives that are reshaped and re-purposed, wherein she also refurbishes items that are otherwise headed for the trashbin!  A former Miss Illinois in the Miss America Scholarship Program, Lori has always taken a special interest in leading other women.  She also "directs" a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that offers rehabilitation to women who are transitioning out of the sex industry. So here she is with Miss Mona and team...God bless ya'll!  Thanks for this lovely opportunity.

    Elvis Aaron Presley, in the humblest of circumstances, was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. He and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1948, and Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. 
    
    Elvis’ musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church and at the all-night gospel sings he frequently attended, and the black R&B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, he began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. By 1956, he was an international sensation. With a sound and style that uniquely combined his diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time, he ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture. 
    
    He starred in 33 successful films, made history with his television appearances and specials, and knew great acclaim through his many, often record-breaking, live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 150 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards and accolades were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36, and his being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees. Without any of the special privileges his celebrity status might have afforded him, he honorably served his country in the U.S. Army. 
    
    His talent, good looks, sensuality, charisma, and good humor endeared him to millions, as did the humility and human kindness he demonstrated throughout his life. Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture. Elvis died at his Memphis home, Graceland, on August 16, 1977.
