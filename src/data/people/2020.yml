    A long-standing member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in January 2002, an inductee into The Theater Hall of Fame, Charles Strouse's first Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie_ (1960), won him a Tony® Award and the London Critics Best Foreign Musical Award. In 1970, _Applause_, starring Lauren Bacall, achieved the same honors and his smash hit, _Annie_ (1977), also won a Tony® for Best Score as well as two Grammy Awards®. Some of his other musicals include _All American_, _Golden Boy_ (starring Sammy Davis Jr.), _It's A Bird, It's A Plane, It's Superman_, _I And Albert_, directed in London by John Schlesinger, and _Dance A Little Closer_, written with Alan Jay Lerner. _Charlie & Algernon_ won a 1981 Tony® nomination for Best Score, as did _Rags_ in 1987 and _Nick And Nora_ in 1992. He wrote both the music and lyrics for off-Broadway's _Mayor_, and teamed again with Martin Charnin to create _Annie Warbucks_, the sequel to _Annie_. His film scores include _Bonnie & Clyde_, _The Night They Raided Minsky's_, and _All Dogs Go To Heaven_. "Those Were The Days", the theme song for TV's _All In The Family_ is a Strouse song, with lyrics by his most frequent collaborator, Lee Adams. "Born Too Late", a 1958 pop song written with Fred Tobias, was a top-10 BILLBOARD chart hit and is still heard on many oldies stations. The quadruple platinum album title song by Jay-Z, "Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)", won the 1999 Grammy for the best Rap album, charted for more than a year and won the BILLBOARD 1998 R&B Album of the Year Award. Strouse's far-ranging talents include chamber and orchestral works, a piano concerto, a two-piano sonata, and operas. His latest choral work, "The Child In Us All", premiered in Spring, 2000. _Nightingale_, an opera based on the Hans Christian Andersen story for which he wrote music, book and lyrics, was recorded by Sarah Brightman. Strouse was commissioned in 2001 to write _Concerto America_ for the pianist Jeffrey Biegel. The work premiered in June 2002 with the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall. Charles Strouse created the ASCAP Musical Theatre Workshop in New York, where he encouraged the talents of countless young composers, writers and performers. In 1999, Strouse received the ASCAP Foundation Richard Rodgers Award for Career Lifetime Achievement in Musical Theatre. In December, 1995, a tv reinterpretation of the classic _Bye Bye Birdie_ (starring Jason Alexander and pop-star Vanessa Williams) aired on ABC-TV. The 1995/96 Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics was given to the new song written for and performed by Vanessa Williams: "Let's Settle Down". Another TV interpretation in 1999, _Annie_, aired on ABC's Wonderful World of Disney, swept the ratings by winning over 40 million viewers, won the 1999 Peabody Award and 2 Emmy Awards. The show starred Kathy Bates, Audra McDonald, Alan Cumming, Kristin Chenoweth, Victor Garber, Andrea McArdle and Alicia Morton as Annie and ranked #1 as movie of the year. A revised _Golden Boy_ was produced by the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven (November, 2000); and The ENCORES! Series presented the show in March, 2002. Future projects: _Golden Boy_ will be performed at the Greenwich Theatre in England in June, 2003. _The Night They Raided Minsky's_, which Charles Strouse originally scored for film, has been turned into a full-length musical. The Broadway-bound version has a book by the late Michael Okrent and Evan Hunter, lyrics by Susan Birkenhead. The Manhattan Theatre Club has scheduled the show for its 2003-04 season. An adaptation of the Paddy Chayevsky film _Marty_, had a successful regional theatre run at Huntington Theatre in Boston in September, 2002. The show reunites Strouse with Lee Adams as lyricist; the book is by Rupert Holmes. John C Reilly starred in the Huntington production and will later again star when the show comes to Broadway next season.

    Andrew Lloyd Webber is the composer of some of the world’s best-known musicals including _Cats_, _Evita_, _Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat_, _Jesus Christ Superstar_, _The Phantom Of The Opera_ (which celebrates its 32nd anniversary on Broadway this year) and _Sunset Boulevard_.

    When _Sunset Boulevard_ joined _School Of Rock – The Musical_, _Cats_ and _The Phantom Of The Opera_ on Broadway in February 2017 he became the only person to equal the record set in 1953 by Rodgers and Hammerstein with four shows running concurrently.

    As well as _The Phantom Of The Opera_ and _Cats_ his productions include the groundbreaking Bombay Dreams, which introduced the double Oscar-winning Bollywood composer AR Rahman to the Western stage.

    As a composer and producer, Lloyd Webber is one of an elite group of artists to have achieved EGOT status by receiving an Emmy, four Grammys including Best Contemporary Classical Composition for "Requiem", his setting of the Latin Requiem mass, an Oscar and eight Tony Awards including the 2018 Special Tony for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre. He has won seven Oliviers and a Golden Globe and his honors include the Praemium Imperiale, the Richard Rodgers Award for Excellence in Musical Theatre, a BASCA Fellowship, and the Kennedy Center Honor.

    He owns seven London theatres including the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the London Palladium. He is the only theatre owner to re-invest every cent of profits into his buildings.

    He is passionate about the importance of music in education and the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation has become one of Britain’s leading charities supporting the arts and music. In 2016 the Foundation funded a major new national initiative which endowed the American Theatre Wing with a $1.3 million, three-year grant to support theatre education opportunities for young people and public schools across the U.S.

    He was knighted by Her Majesty The Queen in 1992 and created a life peer in 1997.

    To mark his 70th birthday, his bestselling autobiography _Unmasked_, was published by HarperCollins in March 2018.

    Thomas Stearns (T. S.) Eliot (1888—1965) was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on September 26, 1888. He was educated at Harvard, at the Sorbonne in Paris and at Merton College, Oxford. He settled in England in 1915 and taught briefly at two schools before joining Lloyds Bank in the City of London in their foreign and colonial department. His first volume of poems, _Prufrock And Other Observations_, was published in 1917. _The Waste Land_, his most famous work, came out in 1922. In 1925 he left the bank to become a director of the publishing house of Faber. There have been several collected editions of his poetry and volumes of his literary and social criticism. Eliot also wrote a number of verse plays, the best-known of which, _Murder In The Cathedral_, was commissioned for the Canterbury Festival of 1935. Four Quartets, now generally regarded as his masterpiece, was first published in 1943. _Old Possum’s Book Of Practical Cats_ appeared in October 1939. (Eliot had a great affection for cats and "Possum" was his alias among friends.) Forty-two years later, this work would be combined with the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber to become _Cats_.

    Eliot became a British citizen in 1927. He received many honors and distinctions, among them the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was posthumously awarded two 1983 Tony Awards for the book and lyrics of _Cats_. He was also an Officer de la Legion d'Honneur. He died in London in January, 1965, and there is a memorial to him in Poet's Corner, Westminster Abbey.
