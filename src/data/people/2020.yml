#     This is Tom Hudson's first season with Post Playhouse, and he couldn't be more thrilled to be part of this amazing company, and to meet the wonderful, supportive patrons and citizens of in northwestern Nebraska!

#     Raised on the beaches of Galveston, Tom Hudson is a native Texan who has never quite been able to stay in one place! Mr. Hudson became interested in design early on when, as a young boy, he was taken to an exhibit of costume s worn in the BBC production of The Six Wives of Henry the Eighth, and discovered that the jewelry was made from sprockets, nuts, and bolts. Thus began a career of seeing things not as they are, but of what they might become. Notably, while only 15 years of age, Mr. Hudson, accidentally, became the youngest recipient of the USITT Design America Commendation when, his high school theater teacher misunderstood the requirements for entry (it only being open to working professionals), and sent in three costume designs executed by Tom for the play The Torchbearers, where he was displayed alongside such venerable artists such as Theoni V. Aldredge and Ming Cho Lee

#     Mr. Hudson received his BFA from East Texas State University, and his MA from Carnegie Mellon University, and is a museum curator with his discipline being historic textiles and conservation. Over the past 30 years Tom has designed costumes on more than 250 productions for such institutions as, New York City Opera, Seattle Opera, and Club Med, with Monteverdi's Il Rittorno d'Ullisse in Patria and Rossini's La Cenerentola being two favorites.

#     In recent years, Mr. Hudson has made forays into the Central and South American theatrical markets with works for the Republic of Panama, and Carnival in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

#     Tom Hudson, is also a proud veteran of the United States Navy, achieving the rank of Petty Officer Second Class, and served during the first Gulf War. It was during his European deployment that he was able to develop and refine his design skills by working with Ta Fantastika in Prague, Republic of Czech and Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania, Sicily, and where he discovered his passion for masks, large scale puppetry, and youth theater.

#     Tom is also a writer and producer for his own companies, Spellbound Theatricals, and Inner Circle, with scripts that range from adult-oriented farces such as: Attack of the Martian Space Babes and, A Very Naughty Lady, to classics, The Odyssey and Anne of Green Gables, as well as faith based offerings; The Story of Esther, and Respectfully Yours, Daniel. He is also working on writing his first textbook for young costume designers as a compendium of tips and tricks for setting up and operating a small costume shop.

#     Tom currently calls southwestern Minnesota home, and lives in a 110 year old converted hunting cabin, on the shores of a spring fed lake, with an over-fed Beagle, a neurotic Toy Aussie Shepherd, and a cat who will never know he isn't the King of Siam.
