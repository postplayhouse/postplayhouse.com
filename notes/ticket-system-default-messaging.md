# Privacy and Security Policy

## Disclosure of Personal Information:

%TicketSystemName% is committed to keeping your personal information strictly confidential. Only the organization of the performance for which tickets were purchased will retain your information. When we collect your personal information (i.e. name, address, e-mail, and telephone number) it is in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to notify you about program updates, services and answer inquiries. Beyond the presenting organization for your event it is our policy not to disclose any of your personal information at any time, unless you tell us to do so. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties. From time to time, we'll share aggregated (collective) information about our members as a group, or generate aggregate reports and market research for business partners. These reports will not identify individual members.

## Cookies:

Our site uses cookies to personalize and improve your shopping experience. These cookies do not contain any confidential or personal information.

For example, if you have added products to your shopping cart and suddenly have to log out of our site, you can return later that day and still have those items in your shopping cart.

## Security:

We use industry-standard methods to protect your information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data. To ensure the safety of your personal information, including your credit card number, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology. SSL protects information as it crosses the Internet. Any data stored is kept in a secure off-site location and stored in a password-protected server. Please be aware, of course, that there is no such thing as perfect security - on or off the Internet.

Please keep security in mind as you reach other websites through links from %TicketSystemName%. Each separate company has its own privacy policies and practices and may market to you accordingly. Although we choose our business partners carefully, we can make no representations concerning privacy and security on those sites.

Your password is your key to your account. You should never share it with anyone and we request that you change it periodically and often. You can change your password at any time by accessing My Account on our home page. If you can't remember your password, the reminder phrase you entered when you last changed or set-up your password will be e-mailed to you immediately. You may also contact us at %PolicyEmail% for additional help. We strongly urge you to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your shopping to prevent someone else from accessing your account.
