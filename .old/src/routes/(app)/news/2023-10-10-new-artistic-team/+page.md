Dear friends,

The Post Playhouse Board, staff, and artists are grateful to all of our supporters for a wonderful 2023 season. We were proud to give northwest Nebraska another summer of quality musical theatre entertainment thanks to the leadership of Andy Meyers, who served as producing artistic director.

As we look toward the 2024 season, the Post Playhouse is thrilled to announce two familiar faces are stepping up to leadership positions. Seasoned artist and leader, Dewayne Barrett will be returning as head artistic director, while Ken Phillips, who has worked at the Post Playhouse since 2014, will be the managing director.

Barrett is looking forward to stepping into the leading artistic role at Post Playhouse.

“I am so excited to be returning to where my heart belongs, and that is the Post Playhouse,” Barrett said. “I am looking forward to continuing to bring top notch professional entertainment to Crawford, Nebraska.”

Barrett had his first season in 2016 and immediately fell in love with the theatre, the region, and the people. In 2017, he became associate artistic director as well as directing and choreographing several productions. Originally from Atlanta, he moved to New York City to begin his career. He has performed in leading roles around the country, appearing in Cats, Crazy for You, West Side Story, and A Chorus Line. He has directed and choreographed for national tours, regional theatres, dinner theatres, community theatres, cruise ships, movies, high schools, music videos, parades, dance companies, and internationally at The Central Academy of Drama in Beijing, China. He said he is excited to continue bringing professional talent from across the country. Barrett added he is looking forward to working with Phillips and he knows together they will bring the best entertainment to northwest Nebraska.

Phillips said he is honored to be stepping into a new role for the Post Playhouse. Ten years ago Phillips joined the Post Playhouse family as the stage manager and fell in love with the people, area, and met his wife while working at Post. He has grown with the Post Playhouse over the past decade by becoming the production manager, season lighting designer, and media projection designer. Phillips said he would like to thank the community for always welcoming him back every year and is excited to take on a more involved role with the theatre.

Two of Phillips’ students at the University of Arizona, Kathryn Kulaga and Mesa Winder, have also worked at the Post Playhouse. Both of his students said he’s wonderful at his job and are grateful for his leadership in the classroom and at the Post Playhouse.

Barrett and Phillips are thrilled to begin the 2024 season and its slate of shows will be announced soon.
