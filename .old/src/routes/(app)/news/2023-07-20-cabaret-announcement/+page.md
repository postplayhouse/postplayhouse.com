Come join the cast and company at Post Playhouse for our annual cabaret and fundraiser on **Monday, July 31, 2023 at 7 pm!**

This will be a special evening to celebrate our 2023 season, enjoy some wonderful entertainment, and perhaps even see some teasers about our soon-to-be-announced 2024 season!

All proceeds raised at the event will go to support our nonprofit theatre and allow us to continue bringing wonderful professionals from all over the country to our little corner of Nebraska!

Hors d’oeuvres and a selection of beverages will be included in the donation amount.

**Seats are on a first come first serve basis, so please RSVP to [tickets@postplayhouse.com](mailto:tickets@postplayhouse.com) right away with your name, number of guests, and the donation amount you would like to make.**

You can make your donation for the cabaret by bringing a check with you that evening, donating online at www.postplayhouse.com/donate and writing “Cabaret” in the memo, or you can mail a check to:

**Please consider donating $25 or more per person that attends the performance.**
